        <p>
            Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded not-for-profit educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech fields like

            <li>Internet Of Things</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>C</b>loud Native computing:</h3>
        <p>
            The Cloud Native Computing program prepares the students to program in open source technologies like, <strong>Linux</strong>, <strong>Docker</strong>, <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>NodeJs</strong>, <strong>React</strong> and <strong>React Native</strong> while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
        </p>

        <h3>Artificial Intelligence:</h3>
        <p>
            The artificial intelligence program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Numpy</strong>, <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>Tensorflow 2.0</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong>, and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
        </p>

        <h3>Blockchain:</h3>
        <p>
            The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchains like <strong>Ethereum</strong> and <strong>Hyperledger (Fabric)</strong>, and learn to program in languages such as <strong>Solidity</strong>, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) of a project/token.
